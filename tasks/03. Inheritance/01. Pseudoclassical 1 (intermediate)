Utilize the prototype property to have Car instances share the honk method rather than each creating their own.
--
var Car = function Car () {
  this.honk = function () {
    console.log('Honk!');
  };
};

//Car.proto..

var bmw = new Car();
bmw.honk();

var honda = new Car();
honda.honk();

assert(bmw.honk === honda.honk);
